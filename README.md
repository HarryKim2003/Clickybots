# Clickybots

Fun interactive game coded in Python. Click on bots before they hit the core. 


Unfortunately, Git does not like it when you add music files to repos. So, go to this drive link and throw in the files into the same folder as the .py 
for proper functionality. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5TcpGJbOjAuxP1C-K0FxVRsGXmhN2pd/view?usp=sharing 

Launch game by launching the Python file. Might want to grab a good mouse.
